# About
**Pyseal** is an "Operating System"  *(Not really)* that is fully text based and is meant to be ran in some sort of emulated web environment like [CodeHS](https://www.codehs.com) since it can run multiple files and doesn't require specific file paths, some day it'll be reprogrammed to ran in normal consoles. *(with more features ofc like actual visuals)*
## How it works
It consists of a few files, *this one*, a bootloader, and the mainfile so far as of now but soon I want to remake some portions in TypeScript or JS for simple objects for the menus.
## How to contribute
I'm fine with any forking or modifications, I'd love to see how everyone uses my code and modifies it. As long as you're not claiming any non-modified code as yours then do whatever you want with it.
